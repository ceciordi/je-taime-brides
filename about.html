					"I met Cecilia through work more than 10 years ago and we have been friends ever since.  She is one of the most talented hairstylists I have known.
					She has cut my hair for years too and I am not an easy customer but she always gets it more than just right - it's perfect!  When I got married, there was
					absolutely no one else I would've have trusted to style my hair.  Cecilia knew exactly what I wanted and my hair was perfect from beginning to end and I couldn't believe my hair could ever look so nice! The day I got married was the most special day in my life (along with the day my son, Matthew, was born) and I have never felt so very pretty.  It was cold and windy too and not a strand of hair was out of place from beginning to end!  A testament to the perfectionist and professional that she is! I recommend Cecilia with all my heart!

					Cecilia Romero’s creations are the most beautiful I have ever seen in the industry. I am deeply grateful to her for elevating our wedding with her transformative designs, which surpassed and outshone anything I could have described or imagined. Cecilia’s extraordinary talent and world of experience leaves no question why her client list is legendary.

					I have been getting my hair styled for over 5 years by Cecilia. Her talent is rare in that it is a combination of precision and artistic interpretation. I am certain that she has developed a personal hairstyle for me that is the best one I have ever had. I am quite particular about my appearance and am very glad to have found a stylist who is traditionally trained and has artistic flair. I have been getting compliments and stopped on the street to ask where i get my hair done ever since. Thank you Cecilia !!!!
